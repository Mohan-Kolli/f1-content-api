Yes, you can write a method in Java to delete a folder and all its subfolders and contents. This method can use the `java.nio.file` package, specifically `Files` and `FileVisitor` to traverse the directory structure and delete each file and directory.

Here's a sample method that demonstrates how to achieve this:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.file.*;
import java.nio.file.attribute.BasicFileAttributes;

public class DirectoryDeleter {

    /**
     * Deletes a directory and all its subdirectories and contents.
     *
     * @param dirPath the path to the directory to be deleted.
     * @throws IOException if an I/O error occurs.
     */
    public static void deleteDirectory(Path dirPath) throws IOException {
        // Create a FileVisitor to walk through the directory
        Files.walkFileTree(dirPath, new SimpleFileVisitor<Path>() {
            @Override
            public FileVisitResult visitFile(Path file, BasicFileAttributes attrs) throws IOException {
                // Delete the file
                Files.delete(file);
                return FileVisitResult.CONTINUE;
            }

            @Override
            public FileVisitResult postVisitDirectory(Path dir, IOException exc) throws IOException {
                // Delete the directory after visiting all its contents
                Files.delete(dir);
                return FileVisitResult.CONTINUE;
            }
        });
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            // Define the path to the directory to be deleted
            Path dirPath = Paths.get("path/to/directory");

            // Delete the directory and its contents
            deleteDirectory(dirPath);
            System.out.println("Directory deleted successfully!");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("An error occurred while deleting the directory: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

Here's how the code works:

- The method `deleteDirectory` accepts a `Path` parameter representing the directory path to be deleted.
- The method uses `Files.walkFileTree` to traverse the directory structure using a `SimpleFileVisitor`.
- In the `visitFile` method, each file encountered is deleted using `Files.delete`.
- In the `postVisitDirectory` method, each directory is deleted using `Files.delete` after visiting all its contents.
- In the `main` method, you can specify the path to the directory you want to delete and call the `deleteDirectory` method.

This program will recursively delete the specified directory and all its contents, including subdirectories and files. Adjust the directory path in the `main` method to specify the directory you want to delete.
